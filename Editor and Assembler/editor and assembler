On MX Linux (Debian), to write programs in machine language I am using Geany 1.38 with zasm V 4.4 assembler, and the terminal emulator is GTKTerm V 1.2.1.

On Windows 7 (not tested on W10) I've tested, to write programs in machine language I used Crimson Editor V 3.70 with zmac V 18oct2022, and the terminal emulator is Tera Term V 4.106.
